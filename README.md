# smart-shopping-list

This is a spare-time project. I would like to create a full-stack webapplication where I can track my consumption of my household. Not the from the cost point of view but the consumption itself.

The app should be a kind a mix of inventory system and shopping list. The purpose is to be able to predict when the particuler item runs out and make smart suggestions.

Later I would like to make it for mobile with react-native.
